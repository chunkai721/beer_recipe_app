## Implementation approach
We will use Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework, to build our web-based application. Flask is easy to use and allows us to develop a robust application with minimal setup. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap, a popular open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. It will help us design a responsive and mobile-friendly interface. We will use SQLAlchemy, an open-source SQL toolkit and ORM, for the database to store the beer recipes. For version control of recipes, we will use Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. For the cost calculation feature, we will write custom Python functions. For the Traditional Chinese interface, we will use Flask-Babel, a Flask extension for i18n and l10n support.

## Python package name
```python
"beer_recipe_app"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "views.py",
    "config.py",
    "migrations/",
    "templates/",
    "static/"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Recipe{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str ingredients
        +float cost
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +__init__(self, name: str, ingredients: str, cost: float)
        +calculate_cost(self)
    }
    class User{
        +int id
        +str username
        +str password
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime updated_at
        +__init__(self, username: str, password: str)
        +check_password(self, password: str)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" Recipe: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant R as Recipe
    M->>U: create_user(username, password)
    U->>M: return user
    M->>U: login_user(username, password)
    U->>M: return user
    M->>R: create_recipe(name, ingredients, cost)
    R->>M: return recipe
    M->>R: update_recipe(id, name, ingredients, cost)
    R->>M: return recipe
    M->>R: delete_recipe(id)
    R->>M: return success
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
