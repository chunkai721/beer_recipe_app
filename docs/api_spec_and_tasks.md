## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains configuration variables for the application."),
    ("models.py", "Contains SQLAlchemy models for User and Recipe."),
    ("forms.py", "Contains WTForms forms for user registration, login, and recipe creation."),
    ("views.py", "Contains Flask routes for user registration, login, and recipe CRUD operations."),
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the application."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "views.py",
    "main.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains configuration variables for the application, such as the secret key for Flask and the database URI for SQLAlchemy.
'models.py' contains SQLAlchemy models for User and Recipe. The User model has a method for checking the password.
'forms.py' contains WTForms forms for user registration, login, and recipe creation. These forms include validation.
'views.py' contains Flask routes for user registration, login, and recipe CRUD operations. These routes handle form submission and rendering templates.
'main.py' is the main entry point for the application. It initializes the Flask app and the database, and it includes the routes from 'views.py'.
